/**
 * From RFC1459:
 *
 * ##########################################################################
 *
 * 4.2.1 Join message
 *
 *       Command: JOIN
 *    Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]
 *
 *    The JOIN command is used by client to start listening a specific
 *    channel. Whether or not a client is allowed to join a channel is
 *    checked only by the server the client is connected to; all other
 *    servers automatically add the user to the channel when it is received
 *    from other servers.  The conditions which affect this are as follows:
 *
 *            1.  the user must be invited if the channel is invite-only;
 *
 *            2.  the user's nick/username/hostname must not match any
 *                active bans;
 *
 *            3.  the correct key (password) must be given if it is set.
 *
 *    These are discussed in more detail under the MODE command (see
 *    section 4.2.3 for more details).
 *
 *    Once a user has joined a channel, they receive notice about all
 *    commands their server receives which affect the channel.  This
 *    includes MODE, KICK, PART, QUIT and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE.  The
 *    JOIN command needs to be broadcast to all servers so that each server
 *    knows where to find the users who are on the channel.  This allows
 *    optimal delivery of PRIVMSG/NOTICE messages to the channel.
 *
 *    If a JOIN is successful, the user is then sent the channel's topic
 *    (using RPL_TOPIC) and the list of users who are on the channel (using
 *    RPL_NAMREPLY), which must include the user joining.
 *
 *    Numeric Replies:
 *
 *            ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS              ERR_BANNEDFROMCHAN
 *            ERR_INVITEONLYCHAN              ERR_BADCHANNELKEY
 *            ERR_CHANNELISFULL               ERR_BADCHANMASK
 *            ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL               ERR_TOOMANYCHANNELS
 *            RPL_TOPIC
 *
 *    Examples:
 *
 *    JOIN #foobar                    ; join channel #foobar.
 *
 *    JOIN &foo fubar                 ; join channel &foo using key "fubar".
 *
 *    JOIN #foo,&bar fubar            ; join channel #foo using key "fubar"
 *                                    and &bar using no key.
 *
 *    JOIN #foo,#bar fubar,foobar     ; join channel #foo using key "fubar".
 *                                    and channel #bar using key "foobar".
 *
 *    JOIN #foo,#bar                  ; join channels #foo and #bar.
 *
 *    :WiZ JOIN #Twilight_zone        ; JOIN message from WiZ
